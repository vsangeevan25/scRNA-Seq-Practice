# scRNA-Seq-Practice
I am a fifth-year PhD student at Rutgers, Waksman Institute of Microbiology. Part of my PhD thesis involves optimizing and analyzing translation initiation profiling and RNA-seq data. This repository supports my efforts to master scRNA-seq, inspired by training at MSKCC. It includes Python notebooks where I recreate analyses from published papers.
