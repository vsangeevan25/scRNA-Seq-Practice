# scRNA-Seq Practice

## Introduction
Welcome to my scRNA-Seq Practice repository! I am a fifth-year PhD student at Rutgers University, Waksman Institute of Microbiology. My passion for bioinformatics began with my PhD thesis, which focuses on optimizing and analyzing translation initiation profiling and RNA-seq data. Recently, I've expanded my expertise into single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques, fueled by a workshop I attended at MSKCC and my broader academic interests.

## Project Description
This repository is a collection of my efforts to deepen my understanding and skills in scRNA-seq. Inspired by cutting-edge training and my commitment to pursuing a career in this dynamic field, I recreate analyses from published papers here. Each project within this repository represents a comprehensive exercise in replicating and understanding the intricate data manipulations and visualizations that drive contemporary bioinformatics research in scRNA-seq.
